## Hi there, I'm MinHyuk. 👋
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Deep Learning Developer with a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from 2024, where I dived deep into solving distributed source coding through AI. My curiosity and passion for AI have led me to explore various domains, with a recent focus on "generative AI" and "image processing".

About Me
* 🎓 Graduated with a Master's in Computer Science in 2024, my thesis focused on constructing the architecture for distributed source coding using AI technologies.
* 💡 Fascinated by all things AI, with current interests in generative AI and image processing technologies.
* 🛠 I've been involved in diverse projects, leveraging AI to solve real-world problems within various fields.

# Projects
### My projects showcase a blend of AI application and innovation across different domains:

* 5G-NR Communications Package Development: Try using PyTorch for your 5G NR communication simulator instead of Matlab! With PyTorch, you can more easily simulate 5G NR communication based on deep learning algorithms. Please check here 👉 [💻](https://github.com/K-MinHyuk/CapstoneDesign2022_1_DEML).

* Medical Data Classification: Did you know that the diagnosis of tuberculosis is often made solely through the visual assessment by doctors? How about seeking assistance from artificial intelligence? Here is a deep learning model that can be used as an aid in diagnosing tuberculosis in infants. This model estimates the probability of tuberculosis diagnosis in infants and suggests the location of lesions based on Grad Cam. Please check here 👉 [🩺](https://github.com/K-MinHyuk/CapstoneDesign2022_1_DEML).

* Segmentation in Medical Data: Are you aware that distinguishing the pancreas in abdominal CT images is challenging? Not only is the pancreas difficult to visualize, but pancreatic cancer can also be dangerous. I introduce a model that segments the location of the pancreas. Please check here 👉 [🩻](https://github.com/K-MinHyuk/Pancreas_segmentation).

</p>

* Game Data Analysis: Analyzed game data to derive insights that inform strategy and game design improvements. Please check here 👉 [🎮](https://github.com/K-MinHyuk/OP.gg_hackathon). 
* Reinforcement Learning in Gaming: The 2048 game is a fun puzzle game. How about solving this classic game through reinforcement learning? Will the model use a strategy similar to humans, pushing the larger numbers to the corners? Please check here 👉 [🕹️](https://github.com/K-MinHyuk/2048_reinforcement).
